This Website is basically a Home Delivery System, allowing the customers to order COVID related essential services at home. 
The need of this service was felt to make sure that the basic COVID(medical) essential products reach the public as a lot of people are either reluctant to go out of their homes during lockdown and curfews, 
or don’t want to go out. COVID has affected all our lives drastically, and tested our healthcare systems. 
To make things a little easy for the public, for their convenience, this online system allows the consumers to order some of the COVID related essential services from their homes. 
By computerizing the delivery system, we will be able to overcome many limitations and will be able to make it more efficient.
